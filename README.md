## Project Structure
The `/src` directory contains the game's code.

In the `/scenes` directory, you can find all the Godot scene files.

Images, audio, and JSON files can be found in the `/assets` directory.

In the game, it's possible to change the language, and additional languages can be easily added by creating a specific JSON file in the `/assets/languages` directory with the corresponding language code (e.g., `/en.json`).

To modify and/or add levels, towers, and aliens, you can find the data files in JSON format in the `/assets/data` directory.
